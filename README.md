[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphaware/neo4j-uuid.png)](https://travis-ci.org/graphaware/neo4j-uuid) | <a href="http://graphaware.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Downloads</a> | <a href="http://graphaware.com/site/uuid/latest/apidocs/" target="_blank">Javadoc</a> | Latest Release: 2.1.3.11.1

GraphAware UUID is a simple library that transparently assigns a UUID to newly created nodes in the graph and makes sure nobody
can (accidentally or intentionally) change or delete them.

Getting the Software
--------------------

### Server Mode

When using Neo4j in the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-installation.html" target="_blank">standalone server</a> mode,
you will need the <a href="https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-framework" target="_blank">GraphAware Neo4j Framework</a> and GraphAware Neo4j UUID .jar files (both of which you can <a href="http://graphaware.com/downloads/" target="_blank">download here</a>) dropped
into the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j installation. After changing a few lines of config (read on) and restarting Neo4j, the module will do its magic.

### Embedded Mode / Java Development

Java developers that use Neo4j in <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/tutorials-java-embedded.html" target="_blank">embedded mode</a>
and those developing Neo4j <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-plugins.html" target="_blank">server plugins</a>,
<a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-unmanaged-extensions.html" target="_blank">unmanaged extensions</a>,
GraphAware Runtime Modules, or Spring MVC Controllers can include use the UUID as a dependency for their Java project.

#### Releases

Releases are synced to <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22uuid%22" target="_blank">Maven Central repository</a>. When using Maven for dependency management, include the following dependency in your pom.xml.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.graphaware.neo4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>uuid</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.3.11.1</version>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>

#### Snapshots

To use the latest development version, just clone this repository, run `mvn clean install` and change the version in the
dependency above to 2.1.3.11.2-SNAPSHOT.

#### Note on Versioning Scheme

The version number has two parts. The first four numbers indicate compatibility with Neo4j GraphAware Framework.
 The last number is the version of the UUID library. For example, version 2.1.3.11.1 is version 1 of the UUID library
 compatible with GraphAware Neo4j Framework 2.1.3.11.
